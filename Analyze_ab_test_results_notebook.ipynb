That is much less than the .9 p-value we'd gotten by running simulations, but it is still far above .05 and allows us to reject the null hypothesis. But what is the null hypothesis in this case? It would be that the ab_page coefficient is equal to or greater than 1. This is because the ab_page coefficient shows how many increases there are in the 'treatment' class for every 1 unit increase of the 'conversion' class. So for the 'treatment' class to do as well or worse than the 'control' class (this is always the experiments null hypothesis), the 'treatment' class needs to incremented by 1 unit or less for every 1 unit increase in the 'conversion' class. Since the ab_page score (.985) is less than 1 and the p-value greater than .05, we can safely fail to reject the null. I am not sure why the p-value was so different in the regression analysis. Both analyses assumed a one-tailed distribution. The null and alternative hypothesis are a little different. Both assume Pnew - Pold = 0 for the null, but the regression model didn't measure directly for that. \n",

Adding extra factors will create confusion if the factors are interrelated. But age, gender, and location should be fairly independent variables. The advantage of adding, say age and gender, might be that we'd discover we were appealing only to a very narrow segment of the population, which -- depending on the content of our site -- we might try to widen. A disadvantage to trying to add more factors is that we could lose sight of the fact that the goal is to maximize the number of users and the number of converts.

The ab_page coefficient and p-value results here are both the same as above, which suggests to my informants that the interaction between the pages and the countries is of no statistically discernable consequence. This much makes sense to me, although I cannot pretend to understand how a page interacts with a country--if that is indeed different from how well a page does in a given country, which I guess is what I'm being told is true."
